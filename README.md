### Project 1: False discovery rate methods for analyzing multidimensional mass spectrometry measurements with AI
- Description: This project was during the internship of the Community College Internship (CCI) program at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). It is centered around false discovery rate analysis based on target-decoys strategy. The goal is to rate the false positive outcomes from data identifications of proteomics and metabolomics in biological samples. We learned some biological material and used Python programming language to create a decoy database to use for the FDR analysis.
